# release.sh — cut a signed release of one kind:
#   make release-alpha     VERSION=vX.Y.Z-alpha
#   make release-candidate VERSION=vX.Y.Z-rc.N
#   make release           VERSION=vX.Y.Z
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh <alpha|candidate|release>   (from the repository root)
#
# The argument is the kind the Makefile target stands for; the version must be
# of exactly that kind and the other two are refused (release-versioning §1,
# §1a). All three targets run this one script.
#
# Environment (set by the Makefile target, read raw): REL_VERSION, REL_AGENT_GIT
# (the commit/signing wrapper, no default: this fails closed without it),
# REL_REPO_NAME (the literal repo name, which selects the signing identity) and
# RELEASE_TAG_RE (the Makefile's one definition of a release tag). The forge's
# combined commit status is read with FORGE_API_URL, FORGE_REPOSITORY and
# FORGE_TOKEN (a read token) from the caller's environment.
#
# Every git operation that talks to dev (the tag-free ls-remote, the fetch of
# main and the push) runs through "$REL_AGENT_GIT" "$REL_REPO_NAME", which
# carries the agent's credentials; plain git on a maintainer host has no key for
# dev. Local-only git (rev-parse, status, remote get-url) stays plain.
#
# Everything release.yml's verify job refuses is refused here first, before
# anything is written: the tag has the Makefile's release-tag shape, VERSION is
# the tag without its "v" and no changelog.d fragment is left and CHANGELOG.md
# has the version's heading (all three: `make check-changelog`, run on the
# assembled tree), and the commit is on main (HEAD is dev's freshly fetched
# main). Beyond that: the version moves forward (release-version-check.sh), the
# tag is free locally and on dev (ls-remote exit 2 is the only "free"), the
# tree is clean, and the forge reports a green combined status on HEAD (an
# unreachable forge refuses). Then VERSION is written unprefixed and the
# fragments fold into CHANGELOG.md (`make changelog-assemble`) in one signed
# commit; main and the tag go in one atomic push, so a rejected main never
# leaves the tag behind. Pushing the tag hands off to release.yml, which runs
# the `make ci-fast` gate that a green main status already vouches for.
# shellcheck disable=SC1091,SC2154
